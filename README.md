# Vending-Machine

Virtual Vending Machine
        •       Java OOP JUnit Testing File I/O Pair Programming
What it is: A vending machine CLI application that allows users to feed money, select products, and finish their transactions to receive change. I built this pair-programming style with two others as part of a mini-capstone project at Tech Elevator. 
The application:
        •       Displays a menu when started, allowing users to view items in the machine, purchase an item, or exit
        •       Allows users to repeatedly feed money into the machine in valid, whole-dollar amounts
        •       Allows users to select a product to purchase based on its unique slot identifier
        •       Informs users if the selected product is out of stock or if they do not have enough money to purchase it
        •       Dispenses a product (if valid product is selected) and informs the user of how much money they have remaining
        •       Allows user to finish transaction, which dispenses change in nickels, dimes, and quarters
        •       Logs purchases to a file to allow audits and prevent theft
        •       Has a hidden option on the main menu that shows the total sales since the machine was started
How it was built: Utilized OOP PRINCIPLES to design of the project, then implemented a plan using JAVA.
